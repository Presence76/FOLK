Decreases(folate deficiency, blood levels of homocysteine) is True because Folate deficiency causes increased homocysteine accumulation, which has been associated with neural tube defects in the fetus and an estimated 10% of US heart disease, both of which could be eliminated by folate supplements, food fortification, or better diets [28â€“34].
The claim is [SUPPORTED].

Explanation:
Folate deficiency is a medical condition caused by a low level of folate in the body. It is associated with a variety of health problems, including an increased risk of heart disease, birth defects, and anemia. One of the key ways in which folate deficiency can affect the body is by decreasing blood levels of homocysteine. Homocysteine is an amino acid that can be harmful to the body if it builds up to high levels. Folate helps to break down homocysteine, and a deficiency of folate can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine in the blood. This can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems. In conclusion, a deficiency of folate can decrease blood levels of homocysteine, which can lead to a variety of health problems.
