Deficiency(Autophagy, in the liver) is True because Deficiency in autophagy in LSECs induces endothelial inflammation ultimately leading to liver inflammation and fibrosis. This defective autophagy, in part due to inflammatory mediators of the portal blood, might well be one of the missing links of the progression of simple steatosis to NASH and cirrhosis[282].
